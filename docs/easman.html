<H2><A NAME="2">2.  Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
Although <A HREF="eta.html">ETA</A> is an elegant language, one or
two of its features make it slightly difficult to write in: for
example, the base-seven representation of numbers, using letters
instead of digits; and the necessity to embed absolute line-number in
the code as targets for the Transfer-execution instruction.
<P>
To ameliorate this problem, an ETA assembler, EAS, is provided: this
reads a program in a simple syntax which includes line labels, decimal
constants, character-value constants and file inclusion, and writes an
equivalent pure-ETA program.
<P>
This document specifies the EAS syntax, gives some examples, and
describes how to invoke the assembler.
<P>
Some familiarity with ETA is assumed.



<H2><A NAME="3">3.  Syntax</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="3.1">3.1.  Overview</A></H3>
<P>
The relationship between the EAS source code and the ETA code is
deliberately very close, since EAS has the same relationship to ETA
that (say) a 6502 assembler has to 6502 machine code.  For example,
each line of EAS (except blank lines and those which are blank after
comment-stripping) yields a single, corresponding line of ETA.
<P>
It would be perfectly possible to write a compiler for a high-level
language that produces ETA as its object code, but EAS isn't it.
(Or here's a great idea: someone with a lot of time to kill could
re-target GCC for the ETA virtual machine!)


<H3><A NAME="3.2">3.2.  Comments</A></H3>
<P>
Comments are introduced by a hash character (<TT>#</TT>) and continue
to the end of the line.


<H3><A NAME="3.3">3.3.  Instructions</A></H3>
<P>
The ETA instruction <TT>E</TT>, <TT>T</TT>, <TT>A</TT>, <TT>O</TT>,
<TT>I</TT>, <TT>N</TT>, <TT>S</TT> and <TT>H</TT> may be represented
by themselves, or by the keywords <TT>dividE</TT>, <TT>Transfer</TT>,
<TT>Address</TT>, <TT>Output</TT>, <TT>Input</TT>, <TT>Number</TT>
<TT>and</TT> Subtract respectively.  The single-letter and whole-word
forms may be freely intermixed.
<P>
All instructions are recognised case-insensitively, so (for example),
<TT>divide</TT>, <TT>DIVIDE</TT>, <TT>Divide</TT>, <TT>dividE</TT> and
<TT>DiViDe</TT> are all equivalent.
<P>
Many instructions may occur on a single line, but they must be
separated by whitespace (i.e., a sequence of one or more SPACE and/or
TAB characters.)


<H3><A NAME="3.4">3.4.  Numeric Constants</A></H3>
<P>
The <TT>N</TT>, or <TT>Number</TT>, instruction is unique in that it
alone takes an argument from the EAS program text.  The argument may
follow immediately after the letter <TT>N</TT> if the single-letter
form is used, but must be separated from the whole-word form by
whitespace.
<P>
Numeric constants may be expressed in three ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>As a sequence of decimal digits.
<LI>As a character constant, introduced by a single quote.
<LI>As a label value, introduced by a less-than sign (see below.)
</UL>


<H3><A NAME="3.5">3.5.  Labels</A></H3>
<P>
Labels are provided as an abstraction of addresses, so that portions
of code can be relocated without needing to re-count lines.
<P>
A line may be labelled by prefixing it with the sequence
<TT>&gt;<I>NAME</I>:</TT> (i.e. greater-than, label name, colon.)
There is no limit to the length of labels; they may be contain any
non-white characters other than the colon.
<P>
A label may not be defined more than once.
<P>
A line may carry multiple labels (e.g. <TT>&gt;FOO: &gt;BAR:
<I>code</I></TT>).  This is useful primarily when defining functions:
the first line of a function always needs a public name, used as the
entry point; and sometimes also needs a private name, used only within
the text of the function.
<P>
Labels may be used as the argument to the <TT>N</TT> instruction as in
<TT>N&lt;<I>NAME</I></TT> (i.e. less-than, label name)
<P>
Labels may be used both before and after definition.


<H3><A NAME="3.6">3.6.  File Inclusion</A></H3>
<P>
A line starting with a star (<TT>*</TT>) requests the inclusion at
that point of the file whose name immediately follows the star.  No
intervening whitespace should be used.  Compilation proceeds as though
the starred line were replaced by the contents of the named file.
<P>
Included files may include other files, and so on <I>ad
infinitum</I>.
<P>
Labels defined in an included file may be used in the including file,
and <I>vice versa</I>.  The same label may not be defined in more than
one file contributing to a single compilation.
<P>
The paths of included files are always interpreted relative to the
working directory of the EAS process rather than (for example)
relative to a well-known library directory, or relative the location
of the file containing the inclusion request.  This may be a bug.  Ask
me again next week.



<H2><A NAME="4">4.  Invocation</A></H2>
<!-- ### the ETA manual should also include an Invocation section -->
<P>
The ETA Assembler is invoked as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
eas [ -d ] [ -O ] [ <I>eas-file</I> [ <I>eas-file2</I> ... ] ]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It assembles the <I>eas-file</I>s named on the command-line,
concatenating them into a single program if there are more than one,
and reading the program from standard input if no files are named.  It
writes the assembled ETA program to standard output; so it can be used
as a filter.
<P>
The options have the following effects:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-d
<DD>Print debugging output to standard error.
<DT>-O
<DD>Emit OIL code (q.v.) instead of ETA code.
</DL>
<P>
The debugging output contains details such as the line numbers
assigned to each label; it is unlikely to be of interest to anyone
except the maintainer of the assembler.



<H2><A NAME="5">5.  The Standard Library</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="5.1">5.1.  Overview</A></H3>
<P>
Since most ETA programs need access to the same basic facilities such
as multiplication, numeric input, etc., there is an obvious need for a
standard library of EAS files which can provide these facilities.  The
result is a set of EAS source files, distributed along with the
assembler itself, which have well-known filenames (for inclusion), and
define well-known function names (labels) for calling.  This section
describes the standard EAS library.
<P>
It would be nice also to provide these routines in the form of
compiled ETA code, ideally padded to make good prose or poetry.
Unfortunately, compiled ETA code will in general be different each
time it's used, since it will be Transferring to addresses in itself
and in other standard routines which may be at different locations.
We could ameliorate (but not solve) this problem by getting EAS to
generate position-independent code by calculating Transfer addresses
relative to the current address.  In the mean time, the standard
library is provided in EAS form only.


<H3><A NAME="5.2">5.2.  Conventions</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="5.2.1">5.2.1.  File and Label Names</A></H4>
Standard library files must be named all in lower case, with names no
more than eight letters long, and with a <TT>.eas</TT> extension.
(This restriction is so that the filenames are unambiguous for use on
an MS-DOS or ISO 9660 filesystem.)  For example,
<TT>multiply.eas</TT>, <TT>writenum.eas</TT> and <TT>sum.eas</TT>
would all be legitimate filenames for standard functions:
<TT>Multiply.eas</TT>, <TT>writenumber.eas</TT> and
<TT>sum_num.eas</TT> are not.
<P>
Functions defined in the standard library must be named exactly the
same as the files that contain them except that they must be all in
upper case (and of course omit the <TT>.eas</TT> extension.)  For
example, a standard library file called <TT>multiply.eas</TT> must
define function labelled <TT>MULTIPLY</TT>.
<P>
All the labels used within a function labelled <TT>FOO</TT>, say, must
begin with <TT>FOO</TT>, followed by a lower-case letter or
underscore, followed by any sequence of upper- and lower-case letters
and underscores - there is no length limit.  For example, the
<TT>MULTIPLY</TT> function might internally use the labels
<TT>MULTIPLYloop</TT> and <TT>MULTIPLY_done</TT>.
<P>
These conventions mean that a standard library file called
<TT>foo.eas</TT>, say, has complete control over the namespace of
labels beginning with <TT>FOO</TT> and not followed by another capital
letter; so no clash could arise from a pair of standard library files
called <TT>foo.eas</TT> and <TT>food.eas</TT>, for example.

<H4><A NAME="5.2.2">5.2.2.  Nested Inclusion</A></H4>
When one library routine uses another, should it include it the file
that defines it?  For example, the standard <TT>WRITENUM</TT> routine
uses <TT>WRITESTR</TT>; does that mean that <TT>writenum.eas</TT>
should include <TT>readnum.eas</TT> and save the top-level programmer
the bother?
<P>
No, because in the case where a top-level program includes two or more
complex routines, each of which includes the same lower-level one,
two or more copies of the low-level routine would be included.  Then
before you know it, you're committing Microsoft-level stupidities like
having seventy-odd copies of the <TT>getchar()</TT> code in
<A NAME="jump1">MS-Word</A><SUP><A HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP>.
<P>
It's better, though admittedly clumsy, to require the top-level
program to include all the prerequisite functions of the functions it
uses.  At least the assembler helps with this, by complaining when a
used label is not defined.

<H4><A NAME="5.2.3">5.2.3.  Comments</A></H4>
Each standard library file must begin with a comment line stating the
name of the file, followed a space, two hyphens, a space, and a
one-line description of the file.  Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# multiply.eas -- multiply two numbers
# readnum.eas -- read a decimal number
# writenum.eas -- write a decimal integer
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The next line should be a comment containing version-control
information, if appropriate.  Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# SCCSID("@(#)/home/mike/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.writestr.eas	1.1")
# SCCSID("@(#)/home/mike/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.writenum.eas	1.2")
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If the file requires any other files to be included in order to
provide lower-level routines which it uses, these should be listed,
separated by commas, on a subsequent comment line beginning <TT>#
Requires:</TT>.  Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# Requires: WRITESTR
# Requires: READNUM, MULTIPLY
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(These requirements may seem unnecessarily draconian, but they do
facilitate automatic processing of the library files to produce tables
like the one below.)


<H3><A NAME="5.3">5.3.  Routines</A></H3>
<P>
Here, then, are the routines currently provided in the standard
library:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="3">
<TR>
	<TH ALIGN="left">Label

	<TH ALIGN="left">Description
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>MULTIPLY</TT>
	<TD><I>nothing</I>
	<TD>
	Multiplies together the top two numbers on the stack, leaving
	the product on top of the stack in their place.  The
	multiplication takes time proportional to the argument on top
	of the stack (i.e. the second argument to be pushed), so (for
	example)
	<TT>N50 N5 N1 N&lt;MULTIPLY T</TT> is about ten times faster than
	<TT>N5 N50 N1 N&lt;MULTIPLY T</TT>.
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>WRITESTR</TT>
	<TD><I>nothing</I>
	<TD>
	Writes to the standard output stream the characters that have
	been pushed onto the stack, up to but not including a
	terminating NUL character (zero), and consuming all the
	characters including the NUL.  No implicit newline character
	is written: this must be done explicitly (<TT>N10 O</TT>) if
	required.
	<P>
	Note that the characters must be stacked in reverse order from
	how they are to be displayed, as in <TT>N0 N'o N'l N'l N'e N'H
	N1 N&lt;WRITESTR T</TT>.
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>WRITENUM</TT>
	<TD><TT>WRITESTR</TT>
	<TD>
	Writes to the standard output stream the decimal
	representation of the number on top of the stack, consuming it
	in the process.  No implicit newline character is written:
	this must be done explicitly (<TT>N10 O</TT>) if required.
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>READNUM</TT>
	<TD><TT>MULTIPLY</TT>
	<TD>
	Reads a decimal integer from the standard input stream and
	leaves it on the stack.  An optional leading sequence of space
	characters is consumed, followed by a sequence of digits and a
	terminating space or newline character.
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
(Source code for some of these routines is provided below in the
Tutorial Examples section.)



<H2><A NAME="6">6.  Development/Debugging Hints</A></H2>
<P>
It's worth using the <TT>-d 4</TT> option of the Reference ETA
interpreter to get a debugging trace: before each instruction is run,
this shows the current line-number, the contents of the stack, and the
instruction itself.
<P>
It turns out to be very useful to formalise an invariant that is
always true at the top of a loop.  I always used to look down on this
sort of computer-science-for-the-sake-of-it behaviour, with Bound
Functions and Weakest Preconditions and all that, but I can see where
it comes from now I'm programming a really primitive machine!
<P>
Another useful technique is to comment each line of your EAS program
with a picture of how the stack's expected to look after it executes.
This gives you something to compare the debugging output with.



<H2><A NAME="7">7.  Future Directions</A></H2>
<P>
Possible enhancements for the future include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Syntax to indicate a relative transfer (using the <TT>Address</TT>
	instruction.)
<LI>Facilities for defining and using macros.
<LI>A library of pre-defined macros (pseudo-instructions).
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="8">8.  Tutorial Examples</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="8.1">8.1.  Introduction</A></H3>
<P>
This section presents a sequence of twelve increasingly complex EAS
code fragments - some entire programs, some functions - which together
constitute a small but complete tutorial in the use of EAS to write
Real World ETA programs.  The later examples build on the earlier, to
yield programs of some complexity.


<H3><A NAME="8.2">8.2.  true</A></H3>
<P>
This is a re-implementation of the Unix utility <TT>/bin/true</TT>,
the purpose of which is to return a ``success'' exit-status to the
operating system.  No instructions at all are needed, since falling
off the end of an ETA program is equivalent to an explicit Transfer to
address zero, causing the interpreter to return ``success'' to the
operating system.  So here is the program in its entirety:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL><PRE>
# true.eas -- /bin/true reimplemented in ETA Assembler.
# SCCSID("@(#)/export/home/staff/mike/src/language/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.true.eas	1.1")
</PRE></SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3><A NAME="8.3">8.3.  Hello, World!</A></H3>
<P>
This program prints everyone's favourite message.  The interleaving of
the <B>N</B>umber and <B>O</B>utput instructions is obviously pretty
arbitrary.  I've chosen to avoid the fenceposts: the selected
interleaving is neither
<I>n</I> &times; (<B>N</B>umber; <B>O</B>utput) 
nor
<I>n</I> &times; <B>N</B>umber; <I>n</I> &times; <B>O</B>utput.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL><PRE>
# hello.eas -- the "Hello, world!" program in ETA Assembler.
# SCCSID("@(#)/export/home/staff/mike/src/language/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.hello.eas	1.1")

Number 32	# can't quote a space character: use ASCII value
Number ',  Number 'o  Number 'l  Number 'l  Number 'e  Number 'H
Output Output Output Output Output Output Output
Number 10	# can't quote a newline either
Number '!  Number 'd  Number 'l  Number 'r  Number 'o  Number 'w
Output Output Output Output Output Output Output
</PRE></SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
An alternative approach would be push a marker character on to the
stack - NUL would be an obvious choice - followed by all the
characters of the message, then call a well-known function to output
the stacked characters: see below for this program.


<H3><A NAME="8.4">8.4.  Copying Input to Output</A></H3>
<P>
This program demonstrates the use of the <B>T</B>ransfer instruction
for conditionals (line 4), discarding unwanted values from the stack
(line 5), termination (line 6) and looping (line 7).
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL><PRE>
# pip.eas -- CP/M's "pip" program, copies input to output.
# SCCSID("@(#)/export/home/staff/mike/src/language/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.pip.eas	1.1")

&gt;LOOP: Input				# Read a character
Number 0  Halibut			# Duplicate it for the test
Number 0  Number 1  Subtract Subtract	# Compare with -1 (EOF)
Number &lt;WRITE  Transfer			# If not equal, continue ...
N 0 N 1 H T				# ... otherwise discard -1
Number 1  Number 0  Transfer		# ... and make a successful exit
&gt;WRITE: Output				# Copy the character
Number 1  Number &lt;LOOP  Transfer	# Go back and read the next one
</PRE></SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(Not all the features of the original CP/M <TT>pip</TT> are
implemented!)


<H3><A NAME="8.5">8.5.  Function Definition</A></H3>
<P>
Although this code performs perfectly good addition, its main purpose
is to demonstrate function definition.  (After all, addition is pretty
easy in EAS: just subtract the negation of the number you want to add.
Make the negation by subtracting the number from zero.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL><PRE>
# function.eas -- define a function to add two numbers together.
# SCCSID("@(#)/export/home/staff/mike/src/language/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.function.eas	1.1")

# On entry, stack = ... x y addr
# Prologue: roll args above return address
&gt;ADD: Number 2 Halibut		# ... y addr x
Number 2  Halibut		# ... addr x y

# Add the numbers: subtract y from zero, then the result from a.
Number 0			# ... addr x y 0
Number 1  Halibut		# ... addr x 0 y
Subtract			# ... addr x -y
Subtract			# ... addr x+y

# Epilogue: tidy up stack to leave result on top, then return
Number 1			# ... addr x+y TRUE
Number 2  Halibut		# ... x+y TRUE addr
Transfer			# Return to addr, leaving acc on stack
</PRE></SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The prologue <TT>N2 H N2 H</TT> can be considered as a standard
idiom for entry to a two-argument function; equivalent sequences for
functions of zero, one, three or more arguments are obvious.
<P>
Similarly, the epilogue <TT>N1 N2 H T</TT> can be considered as a
standard idiom for exit from a function of a single return-value.


<H3><A NAME="8.6">8.6.  Function Call</A></H3>
<P>
Here, we demonstrate how to call the addition function defined in the
previous example.  Note that the arguments are pushed on the stack
<I>before</I> the call address, so the calling sequence itself
(<TT>N1 N&lt;ADD T</TT>) can be considered as atomic.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL><PRE>
# add.eas -- test-harness for addition function.
# SCCSID("@(#)/export/home/staff/mike/src/language/eta/easpit/SCCS/s.add.eas	1.1")

Input				# stack: x
Input				# stack: x y
Address N 1  N &lt;ADD  Transfer
Output				# print result
Number 1  Number 0  Transfer 0	# jump to location zero, i.e. stop

# include the addition function
*function.eas
</PRE></SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(This program is not actually particularly useful as it stands, since
the numbers to be added are read as the ASCII values of consecutive
input characters, and the sum is written as the character with the
appropriate ASCII value.)


<H3><A NAME="8.7">8.7.  Writing a String (Variadic Function)</A></H3>
<P>
This is an unusual function, in that it is variadic.  This means
that we can't use a standard prologue to roll the return address
down under the arguments.  Instead we maintain the invariant that the
top of the stack is the return address, and the characters remaining
to be written are immediately below it.
<P>
This invariant is true on entry, so there is no prologue as such.

In addition to being a very useful routine for real programs, this

the technique of using a semi-formal loop invariant and stack

to skip a single line if the number on top of the stack is true.  This
is a classic case of a non-trivial sequence of operations being
treated as an indivisible unit.
<P>
(This routine is an execution bottleneck for many EAS programs, since
it runs in O(<I>arg2</I>) time.  A faster multiplication routine would
be a great boon: but is one even theoretically possible?)


<H3><A NAME="8.11">8.11.  Reading a Number</A></H3>
<P>
This is written as a function of no arguments, returning a single
value.
<P>
The numeric input convention that we use is that any leading spaces
are skipped, then a sequence of non-spaces (assumed but not checked
to be decimal digits) is accumulated numerically, then a terminating
space is consumed.  Pragmatic considerations dictate that a trailing
newline or EOF must be treated as an alternative terminator.
<P>
This is not perfect: we'd like to treat all whitespace equivalently
(but that would be dull); we'd like to check that the digits are
between 0 and 9 (but we have no inequality check); we'd like not to
consume the trailing space (but we don't have a <TT>PEEK</TT> or
<TT>UNGET</TT>) facility.  Nevertheless, this is an invaluable
routine.

<H2><A NAME="9">9.  Appendix: Additional ETA-Programming Tools</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="9.1">9.1.  EASy</A></H3>
<P>
There is a wrapper, EASy, that assembles an EAS program and executes
the resulting ETA code.  As a side-effect, it leaves the ETA program
in a file in the same directory as the EAS program, and whose name is
formed from its name by removing the <B>.eas</B> extension (if any)
and adding a <B>.eta</B> extension.


<H3><A NAME="9.2">9.2.  ETAword</A></H3>
<P>
This is a trivial hack to find words from the system dictionary that
can be incorporated into an ETA program containing a known sequence
of significant characters.  The command-line arguments are sequences
of consecutive instructions to be incorporated into single words.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>etaword nen</TT> &rarr; drunken, gunmen<BR>
<TT>etaword tes</TT> &rarr; cutesy, Rutgers, uterus<BR>
<TT>etaword nt</TT> &rarr; blunt, burnt, grunt<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><A NAME="9.3">9.3.  ETAinst</A></H3>
<P>
This is a truly trivial hack to find the significant characters in
candidate words for an ETA program.  This will tell you (for example)
what your name does, so that you can interpolate it in an ETA program.
<P>
For example:

<TT>etainst Language</TT> &rarr; anae<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><A NAME="9.4">9.4.  [Your Utility Here]</A></H3>
<P>
There are plenty of other ETA-programming utilities yet to be
written.
<P>
An obvious one would be the program that takes an unpadded ETA program
(such as the output of EAS) and writes an equivalent program
consisting entirely of words found in the system dictionary.  A simple
version of this program could be written just by making repeated calls
to <TT>etaword</TT>; although a cleverer version would know something
about grammar, and perhaps even about style and taste.
<P>
There are other possibilities, including (for example): a program to
generate no-op sequences of ETA instructions for harmless inclusion in
programs; a program to re-locate ETA code to start at a different
line; and of course, a disassembler.
<P>
Creators of new ETA-programming utilities are encouraged to email them
to the author (address above) for attributed inclusion in future
releases of the ETA distribution.
