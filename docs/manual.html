<H2><A NAME="2">2.  Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The design of the ETA programming language follows from the axiom that
just because you have to program on a tiny machine, that doesn't mean
your programs have to be unreadable.
<P>
The designers of less ambitious languages such as COBOL intended that
programs written in their languages should be readable to
English-speaking managers as well as trained technical staff.  ETA
goes further by allowing you to write your programs in such a way that
they can easily be read by speakers of whatever language you choose.
<P>
ETA achieves this lofty goal despite, or perhaps because of, its tiny
size.  It has very few instructions, and is thus extremely easy to
learn.  Admittedly, this extraordinary combination of power and
simplicity comes at a cost: there is no guarantee that the natural
language description in the program text will bear any relation to
what the program actually does.
<P>
Why the name ETA?  There are several reasons.  Firstly, it's named
after its own instruction set (see below).  Secondly it's named after
the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet, both to celebrate its use of
the base-7 numbering system, and because it comes a little way before
iota, indicating how tiny the language is.  And thirdly, ETA stands
for Estimated Time of Arrival, which is appropriate since ETA programs
tend to run rather slowly.  Oh, and fourthly, ETA is an anagram of
TEA, which is nice to drink.
<P>
Oh, and
<A HREF="http://www.ocston.org/~harveyt">Harvey Thompson</A>
(<A HREF="mailto:harveyt@sco.COM">harveyt@sco.COM</A>)
suggests the following
alternative interpretations of the ETA acronym:

<H2><A NAME="3">3.  The Language</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="3.1">3.1.  Overview</A></H3>
<P>
The ETA language has only eight instructions, and these are named by
the eight most frequently occurring letters in written English:
<TT>E</TT>, <TT>T</TT>, <TT>A</TT>, <TT>O</TT>, <TT>I</TT>,
<TT>N</TT>, <TT>S</TT> and <TT>H</TT>.  Since the same eight letters
are used to represent numbers (see below), all other characters in an
ETA program are ignored (with the exception of line-breaks - see
below.)  This flexibility allows additional non-functional characters
to be arbitrarily intermingled with the instruction and operand
characters.
<P>
As a further aid to readability, case is not considered significant:
programmers are encouraged to use mixed case in such a way as to
elucidate the structure of the program.
<P>
For example, the following program fragments are all equivalent (they
are no-ops):
<P>

Wunce upun a ET...
Unbend a Pet, ugly!
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><A NAME="3.2">3.2.  Machine Model</A></H3>
<P>
All the instructions work on a stack of signed 32-bit integers.
Implementations must support stack-depth of at least 100.  More is
better.  Infinite is best.
<P>
Two of the instructions use <I>addresses</I>.  An address in an ETA
program is a line-number, counted from one upwards.  (This is why
line-breaks are significant.)  Lines are considered to be terminated
by an LF (ASCII 012), a CR (ASCII 015), a CR-LF pair or an LF-CR pair,
so that ETA programs run portably on systems with different
end-of-record conventions.


<H3><A NAME="3.3">3.3.  Instruction Set Summary</A></H3>
<P>
The instructions are as mnemonic as possible (which in truth is not
really all that mnemonic):
<P>

</TABLE>
<P>
The individual instructions are described in more detail below.


<H3><A NAME="3.4">3.4.  Instruction Set Details</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="3.4.1">3.4.1.  E: The dividE Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Pops two numbers off the stack: first <I>b</I>, then <I>a</I>.
Performs the integer division of <I>a</I> by <I>b</I>, and pushes
first the quotient and then the remainder onto the stack.  For
example, if first 19 and then 7 were pushed onto the stack, then the
dividE instruction would push 2 (the quotient) and then 5 (the
remainder).
<P>
(Sorry about the horrible mnemonic.)

<H4><A NAME="3.4.2">3.4.2.  T: The Transfer Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Pops two numbers off the stack: first <I>addr</I>, then <I>cond</I>.
If <I>cond</I> is non-zero, then control is transferred to the first
significant character on line number <I>addr</I> of the program.  As a
special case, transferring to the address zero terminates the program.
<P>
This is the only conditional instruction in ETA: it is used to build
loops and to call and return from subroutines.
<P>
(It can be hard to remember what order the parameters for this
instruction go on the stack: the author finds it helpful to remember
the word CAT: Condition, Address, Transfer!)

<H4><A NAME="3.4.3">3.4.3.  A: The Address Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Pushes one more than the current address onto the stack.  This is
useful for allowing a Transfer to subroutine followed by a subsequent
Transfer back to the point immediately after.  It can also be used to
construct transfer addresses relative to the current address, yielding
position-independent code.

<H4><A NAME="3.4.4">3.4.4.  O: The Output Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Pops the top number off the stack, and outputs the character whose
ASCII code is that number.  (ASCII is specified so that it's possible
to write ETA programs which will run portably on machines using
different character sets.  This is obviously a pain to implement on
non-ASCII machines.  But as one of our poets has written,
<A HREF="dilbert.gif">``Here's a nickel, kid.  Get yourself a better
computer.''</A>)

<H4><A NAME="3.4.5">3.4.5.  I: The Input Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Reads a single character and pushes its ASCII code onto the stack.
(See the note on ASCII in the previous section.)  If the end of the
input file has been reached, then -1 is pushed.

<H4><A NAME="3.4.6">3.4.6.  N: The Number Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
This instruction pushes its argument on the stack.  It's unique in
that it takes its argument from the program text - all the other
instructions that need operands pop them from the stack.  The argument
is made up of the sequence of significant characters following the
<TT>N</TT>, up to but not including the first occurence of <TT>E</TT>.
Those characters are treated as a big-endian sequence of base-seven
digits with the following values:

<P>

	<TH ALIGN="left">=

	<TD>=
	<TD>3
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
So, for example, the sequence <TT>Ntone</TT> pushes the value 75
(1x7^2 + 3x7^1 + 5x7^0).
<P>
Note that negative numbers can not be expressed in this way: they must
be generated by a <B>S</B>ubtract instruction.
<P>
The characters making up the numeric argument are skipped; they are
not also used as instructions, but execution continues from the first
significant character after the terminating <TT>E</TT> character.
<P>
(The usual ETAOINSH order of the letters is perturbed for the mapping
to digits so as to yield more <TT>E</TT>s - which are common in
English text - and fewer <TT>H</TT>s.)

<H4><A NAME="3.4.7">3.4.7.  S: The Subtract Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Pops two numbers off the stack: first <I>b</I>, then <I>a</I>.
Subtracts <I>b</I> from <I>a</I> and pushes the result onto the
stack.

<H4><A NAME="3.4.8">3.4.8.  H: The Halibut Instruction</A></H4>
<P>
Pops a number, <I>n</I>, off the stack, and modifies the remaining
stack by rolling the <I>n</I>'th from the top to the top.  So when
<I>n</I> is one, it swaps the top two elements; and when <I>n</I> is
two, it rolls the top three elements.
<P>
If <I>n</I> is negative, its absolute value is used, but the specified
element of the stack is copied to the top rather than moved.  So when
<I>n</I> is -1, a stack <B>A B C</B> is transformed to <B>A B C B</B>.
For the purposes of this instruction, zero is conveniently considered
negative, so that <I>n</I>=0 performs a DUP rather than a no-op.
(There are already 246 ways to do a no-op in ETA.)
<P>
I couldn't find a single synonym for ``roll'' that had an ``h'' in it
anywhere, hence the horribly un-mnemonic mnemonic.  Sorry.


<H3><A NAME="3.5">3.5.  Comments</A></H3>
<P>
There is no commenting convention as such in ETA: significant
character are always significant, no matter what context.  The
intention is that the whole of a well-written ETA program is a
comment.
<P>
However, comments may be formed by using words made up entirely of
letters other than the eight significant ones.  This is something of
an art-form in itself.  Good words to use in ETA comments include
<TT>crumbly</TT>, <TT>fulcrum</TT>, <TT>luxury</TT>, <TT>cruddy</TT>,
<TT>buggy</TT>, <TT>fuzzy</TT>, <TT>guru</TT>, etc.
<P>
A related art is to allow significant characters to occur, but only in
sequences which perform no-ops.  For example, <TT>NeS</TT> subtracts
zero from the top of the stack (so be careful not to use it when the
stack is empty); and <TT>NeN</TT><I>anything</I><TT>eT</TT> (where
<I>anything</I> is a sequence of characters other than <TT>e</TT>)
performs a conditional transfer, but the condition is false, so nothing
happens.
<P>
(The author can't use his own first name - <TT>Mike</TT> - in an ETA
program, since its significant sequence is <TT>ie</TT>, which reads a
character and divides the top of stack by its value - so that if a NUL
character is read, an illegal division by zero will ensue.)
<P>
Of course, significant characters may but used in program text with
impunity provided that the afected portion of the program text is
never executed.  For example, anything on a line following the
sequence <TT>NteAT</TT> (transfer control to the next line) will never
be executed.  This could be considered as a commenting convention; but
use of this mechanism is considered poor form.



<H2><A NAME="4">4.  Useful Idioms</A></H2>
<P>
Some idioms emerge repeatedly.  The first batch of these are so common
and useful that they can almost be thought of as additional primitives
(DUP, SWAP, ADD, JUMP, EXIT, SKIP, REM, DROP.)
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="3">

</TABLE>
<P>
Function call and return can be done in a variety of ways, but the
following conventions seem to work quite well:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
The caller pushes the arguments, <I>then</I> the return address.  It
then calls the function by pushing the <B>A</B>ddress of the next line
and unconditionally <B>T</B>ransfering control.
<LI>
The called function will (almost) always need to roll the
arguments above the return address.  For a typical
two-argument function, this can be done with the prologue
<TT>Nae H Nae H</TT>.
<LI>
(The callee does its work, removes the arguments from the
stack, and replaces them with the return values, if any.)
<LI>
The callee needs to prepare for returning by pushing a true
Transfer-condition, and rolling the return address to the top
of the stack.  For a typical single-return-value function,
this can be done with the epilogue:
<TT>Nte Nae H T</TT>.
</UL>
<P>
The thrust of these conventions, especially the first, is to make it
easy for the caller.  (Where necessary, this done at the expense of
the convenience of the callee, since a typical function will be called
many times but defined only once.)
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="3">

</TABLE>
<P>
Functions that wish to use many arguments from the stack, or leave
many values on the stack (e.g. functions dealing with NUL-terminated
strings) will need to make their own arrangements.



<H2><A NAME="5">5.  Future Directions</A></H2>
<P>
Unappealing though it seems, we may be forced to change the assignment
of instructions to letters, so as to allow the most common English
letters to occur most commonly in program text.  With the current
encoding, the letter <TT>N</TT> (the Number instruction) tends to be
most common, followed by <TT>H</TT> (the Halibut instruction),
although both of these letters are towards the lower end of the
frequency-in-prose spectrum; while conversely, the letter <TT>E</TT>
(the dividE instruction) tends to occur least frequently.
<P>
This problem is at least partially addressed by the assignment of
base-seven digits and the number terminator to letters, so
re-assigning the instructions themselves may prove unnecessary.



<H2><A NAME="6">6.  Challenges</A></H2>
<P>
ETA programmers might like to tackle the following challenges:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Write an ETA program containing no instructions at all - just
comments, using only letters other than ETAOINSH.
<LI>
As above, but no-op ETAOINSH sequences are allowed.
<LI>
Write an ETA program in the form of a haiku (i.e. a poem of three
lines, having five, seven and five syllables.)
<LI>
Write an ETA program in the form of a limerick.
<LI>
Write an ETA program whose text describes what it does ...
<LI>
... on a line-by-line basis.
<LI>
Write two functionally equivalent ETA programs whose text describes
them in two different natural languages (e.g. English and French)
<LI>
Extend the previous exercise to several natural languages.
<LI>
Write an ETA program whose text is also valid in another programming
language (e.g. C) ...
<LI>
... and which does the same thing in both languages.
<LI>
Extend the previous two exercises to several programming languages.
</UL>
<P>
Best of Show: I guess the ultimate <I>tour de force</I> in ETA
programming would probably be a suite of functionally equivalent
programs structured as limericks in different languages, in which the
meaning of the limericks describes the function performed by the
code.
<P>
Since numeric constants may be broken across lines, extra style points
can be earned by using the same code sequence both as a continuation
of a numeric constant and (when <B>T</B>ransferred to) code.
<P>
Successful attempts at any of the challenges may be emailed to the
author (address above) for attributed inclusion in future releases of
the ETA distribution.



<H2><A NAME="7">7.  Examples</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="7.1">7.1.  Overview</A></H3>
<P>
Due to the constraints of time, and the desire to construct real,
working ETA programs as quickly as possible, the code below is not
particularly good English.  The ``Hello, World!'' and <TT>pip</TT>
programs are poetry rather than prose; the recursive factorial program
is not padded at all, consisting only of the significant characters.
<P>
More elegant renditions of these programs would be very welcome;
please email them to the author (address above).


<H3><A NAME="7.2">7.2.  Hello, World!</A></H3>
<P>
This program prints everyone's favourite message.  The interleaving of
the <B>N</B>umber and <B>O</B>utput instructions is obviously pretty
arbitrary.  I've chosen to avoid the fenceposts: the selected
interleaving is neither
<I>n</I> &times; (<B>N</B>umber; <B>O</B>utput) 
nor
<I>n</I> &times; <B>N</B>umber; <I>n</I> &times; <B>O</B>utput.

</TR>
<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">line&nbsp;5

</TR>
<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">line&nbsp;14

What could possibly be clearer?  Note how ETA facilitates top-down
program design: this program begins by making high-level calls
describing its algorithm in abstract terms, and then proceeds to
elaborate on how those high-level calls are to be executed.

<P>
The code needs no explanation.



<H2><A NAME="8">8.  Appendix: The Reference Interpreter</A></H2>
<P>
There exists a
<A HREF="eta.gz">reference interpreter</A>
for the ETA language, called simply <TT>eta</TT>, against which all
the example programs in this document, and more, have been tested.  It
is implemented in
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</A>
for maximum portability.
<P>
The reference interpreter is invoked as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
eta [ -d <I>number</I> ] [ -O ] [ <I>eta-file</I> [ <I>eta-file2</I> ... ] ]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It executes the ETA program made by concatenating the <I>eta-file</I>s
named on the command-line, reading the program from standard input if
no files are named.  The ETA program runs with its standard input and
output connected as the interpreters (which means that programs read
from standard input can't do themselves do input.)
<P>
The options have the following effects:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-d
<DD>Print debugging output, at the specified level, to standard error.
<DT>-O
<DD>Interpret the program as OIL code (q.v.) instead of ETA code.
</DL>
<P>
The debugging output is controlled by the value supplied to the
<TT>-d</TT> option: it is composed of separate bitwise components,
described in the following table, which may be ORred together:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="3">
<TR>
	<TH ALIGN="left">Component
	<TH ALIGN="left">Output
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>1
	<TD>Summary of compiled program's size.
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>2
	<TD>``Done.'' message at end of run.
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>4
	<TD>Execution trace: before each instruction is executed, a
	line is emitted of the form
 <TT><I>char</I>/<I>line</I>:&nbsp;<I>stack</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>inst</I></TT>,
	where <I>char</I> is the current program counter, measured in
	significant characters; <I>line</I> is the current line;
	<I>stack</I> is a space-separated list of the values on the
	stack, with the most-recently-pushed to the right; and
	<I>inst</I> is the instruction about to be executed.
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Other ETA implementations exist, including an interpreter written in
C, which is about thirty times as fast as the reference interpreter.
However, whenever their behaviours differ in an area concerning which
this document is ambiguous, the behaviour of the reference
implementation is correct by definition.  Any such ambiguities should
be emailed to the author (address above).
